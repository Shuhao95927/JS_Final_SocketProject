# JS Final Project - Socket.io Project
## Instruction
In this project, Users can interfere with the canvas of other users by creating new cursor flocks and text bubbles.<br>
Participants can interfere with each other. Their behaviors have a real-time influence on others. <br>

I want to simulate the chaos and interference of information overload. (How individuals influence each otherâ€™s<br> perception and behaviors in the age of data smog)

## How to start

```Bash
npm run devStart #type this code into terminal to run this project.
